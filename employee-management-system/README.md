# Employee Management System (Backend)

## Description

This is the backend part of the Employee Management System project. It is built with Spring Boot, providing RESTful APIs to manage employee data. The backend is responsible for handling requests from the frontend, interacting with the database, and performing CRUD operations on employee records.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed. You can check by running `java -version` in your terminal.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Navigate to the project directory and run the application using your preferred IDE (such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse) or build and run it using Maven.

## Running the Application

The application typically runs on a local server. After starting the application, the server will be accessible at a specified port. Ensure the backend server is running before starting the frontend application.

## Endpoints

### GET /employees
- Retrieves a list of all employees.

### GET /employees/{id}
- Retrieves the details of a specific employee by their ID.

### POST /employees
- Adds a new employee to the database.

### PUT /employees/{id}
- Updates the details of a specific employee.

### DELETE /employees/{id}
- Deletes a specific employee from the database.

## Database Configuration

The backend application uses a database (such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or H2) to store employee records. Configure the database connection properties in the `application.properties` file.
